If Hiring Committee recommends hire, congratulations! You have arrived at the final stage of the process. There are about 10-12% candidates not extended offers at this stage. Recruiter requests for External References and Compensation History, conducts reference checks, and prepares a packet for the Offer Review Process.

The Offer Review process:

    Pre-Review Committee
    Compensation Committee Review
    Senior VP Review

There is a small percentage chance of the offer not getting approved at the final SVP review.
